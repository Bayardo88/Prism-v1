# 05 · Documents (Firm)

The firm-wide document library. Analysts and admins use it to find any file the firm holds, organised by measurement date and company, to add folders and uploads, and to preview a file without leaving the page.

## Screens

### Documents — `/documents`
Browse all measurement-date folders, or pick a company to see its tree and preview a document beside it. Reached from **Documents** in the Primary Menu. The company tab (closable ViewTab) returns to All Documents; "Upload Document" leads to the company's Documents page upload modal (10).

Components used: AppFrame/PageHeader (shell), TertiaryMenu, ViewTabBar, ViewTab, Checkbox, CheckboxItem, ButtonIcon, Button, Heading, Text, FilterDropdown, Input, Chip, Badge, ScrollHintPill, TreeItem, FileRow, FileTypeBadge, DocumentViewerHeader, PageStepper, ZoomControl, Spinner, EmptyState, Link, Modal, FormField, ComboboxPanel, Material `icons` (Person, CalendarToday, Link, Folder, UploadFile, KeyboardArrowUp/Down, Search, FilterList, Fullscreen, Description).

Behaviour & rules:
- Left: All Companies list from `db` — the 16 companies drawn in the frame first, then the rest of the 200 A–Z; fund tag = the record's fund (`db.funds`), document count from the frame (or derived from the record for companies the frame doesn't show). "Find Company" searches with `db.companies.search`; the ScrollHintPill count ("↓ 184 companies") is computed. Every company row opens that company's own tree and links to its own Company · Documents page.
- All Documents: one band per measurement date (counts + request progress, Add Subfolder, Upload Document, collapse). 03/31/2025 opens to Backside Blocks → root files (uploader, date, linked area chips) → Company Docs / Exports subfolders.
- Company selected: compact tree (icon-only folder actions) and a viewer. Clicking a file shows "Preparing PDF preview…" (Spinner) for ~1.2s, then the page with PageStepper (1/12) and ZoomControl (100%, Fit). With no file chosen the viewer is an EmptyState.
- Add Folder: opened from a date band's add-folder action. Parent Folder is a read-only field that opens a ComboboxPanel (in flow, because the modal body clips overflow) ("Find a Folder": No Folder, Company Docs, Exports); Folder Name required — Create Folder stays disabled until it is filled; the new folder is appended to the tree. Scrim click does not dismiss once a name is typed.
- "Select all documents" checks every file row; indeterminate when some are checked.
- Viewer body text is placeholder copy, not the real PDF.

## Cross-platform links
- In: Primary Menu → Documents; Waterfalls Workspace drawer file rows (04); company Documents row menu "Open in viewer" (10).
- Out: Upload Document → Company · Documents upload modal (10); empty viewer → Company · Documents (10).

## Gaps & open questions
- Company list row, measurement-date band and viewer page surface are composed in the area folder (no DS directory-list row or folder band).
- TreeItem has no icon slot: the frame's company node uses a building icon (`domain` / `corporate_fare`); code shows the folder glyph.
- Wanted `create_new_folder` for Add Subfolder (not in the icon set; `folder` used).
- The tree's files are the frame's Backside Blocks set for every company (export names carry the company's name); per-company file data is not in the db.
- "Filter by Fund" shows the value in force ("All funds"); the fund filter menu is not built.
- Search / Filter / Full-screen toolbar icons and the viewer's download/copy/rename/delete are inert. Viewer body is placeholder copy.
